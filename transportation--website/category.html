                        We offer Maritime transport (or ocean transport)
                        or more generally waterborne transport, 
                        is the transport of people (passengers) or goods (cargo) via waterways.
                        Freight transport by watercraft has been widely used throughout recorded history,
                        as it provides a higher-capacity mode of transportation for passengers and cargo than land transport, 
                        
                        the latter typically being more costly per unit payload due to it being affected by terrain conditions and road/rail infrastructures.
